// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, 
// print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with 
// the person’s name.

let people: string[] = ["Samad","Ahsan","Arman","Shayan"];

console.log(`Hello, ${people[0]}! How are you?`);
console.log(`Hello, ${people[1]}! How are you?`);
console.log(`Hello, ${people[2]}! How are you?`);
