// Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name.
// Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace 
// around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the white spaces.


let myName: string = "\t\n Muhammad samad \t\n";
console.log("Name with whitespace:", myName);

let strippedName: string = myName.trim();
console.log("Stripped name:", strippedName);
